# 🌸 Claire's Portfolio

Welcome to the codebase behind my personal portfolio — a place to showcase projects, experiment with tech I love, and yell gently into the internet void 🪐

## 💻 Tech Stack

- React + Vite + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Node.js (soon for backend routing!)
- JSON for data storage (no database yet — keeping it light ✨)

## ✨ Features (WIP)

- Project cards rendered from a JSON data file
- Responsive layout & modern UI design
- Planning to add: dynamic project pages, animations, and GitHub API syncing!

## 🚧 In Progress

This repo is a cozy work-in-progress. Expect frequent commits, chaotic creativity, and maybe a few bugs that are just ✨features✨ in disguise.

## 🦋 About Me

I'm Claire — a junior full-stack dev based in Paris 🇫🇷, passionate about beautiful design, clean code, and neurodivergent joy. Currently rebuilding confidence after finishing my training and ready to make ✨ cool things ✨ again.
